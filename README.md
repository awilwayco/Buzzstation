# Buzzstation

## Description 
A React Native app to send commands and receive data to/from blimps with ROS 2 and Flask used for the Backend and React Native and Expo used for the Frontend.

**Note:** This app is not yet complete. It is still in the developmental stage and has only been tested with fake blimps.

<em>Multi-Controller Functionality: The green blimp names indicate blimps not under control, blue indicates the blimp the device currently controls, and red indicates blimps being controlled by other devices. Each device can only control a single blimp at a time. To unselect a blimp, press the blue button to change it back to green. </em>

## Requirements

- A device with the Ubuntu 22.04 Operating System (https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview)

## To-Do

### Backend

Features
- Backend virtual joystick usage
- Re-add rosjoy functionality and test

### Frontend

Features
- Add Auto Button
- Add Virtual Joysticks for the app and test performance and functionality when multiple blimps are being controlled
- Add Full Controller Functionality for web and app users
- Add State Machine text (with dropdown)
- Add All Auto and All Manual Buttons
- Add Calibrate Button (with Height value)
- Add Column Headers
- Add Barometer Integration
- Add Sidebar menu
- Add Tuning Page
- Add Logs Page

Bugs
- Fix Spacing on all platforms/devices (Make buttons resize based on screen dimensions)
- Fix Multi-controller issue of when a device or browser closes and the blimp name button stays red (Add a timeout to check for device)

### Suggestions
- Use a steam deck or mobile device to control blimps instead of an Xbox controller
